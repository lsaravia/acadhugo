abstract: "Fire is one of the most important disturbances of the earth-system, shaping the biodiversity of ecosystems and particularly forests. Anthropogenic drivers such as climatic change and other human activities could produce potentially abrupt changes in fire regimes, triggering more profound transformations like the transition from forests to savannah or grasslands ecosystems. Large biodiversity loss could be produced if these transitions occur. Climate change could enhance fire ignition and spread, potentially producing more extensive, intense, and frequent fires. In this work, we evaluate the possible changes in the Amazon region's fire regime. We parameterize a fire model using remote sensing data on fire extension and temperature, by considering climate projections for the 21st century. In the context of our model, there are two possible regime changes: the critical regime that implies high variability in fire extension and mega-fires, and an absorbing phase transition which would produce the extinction of the forest and transition to a different vegetation state. The fitted model and the projections suggest that the Amazon region is not close to any of these regime changes, but other factors not included in the model could be crucial for determining the probability of such critical transitions."
