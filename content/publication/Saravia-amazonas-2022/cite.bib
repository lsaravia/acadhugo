  abstract = {Fire is one of the most important disturbances of the earth-system, shaping the biodiversity of ecosystems and particularly forests. Anthropogenic drivers such as climatic change and other human activities could produce potentially abrupt changes in fire regimes, triggering more profound transformations like the transition from forests to savannah or grasslands ecosystems. Large biodiversity loss could be produced if these transitions occur. Climatic change could cause conditions that enhance fire ignition and spread, which may potentially produce more extensive, intense, and frequent fires. In this work, by considering climate projections for the 21st century, we evaluate the possible changes in the Amazon region's fire regime. We parametrize a fire model using remote sensing data on fire extension and temperature. In the context of our model, there are two possible regime changes: the critical regime that implies high variability in fire extension and mega-fires, and an absorbing phase transition which would produce the extinction of the forest and transition to a different vegetation state. The fitted model and the projections suggest that the Amazon region is not close to any of these regime changes, but other factors not included in the model could result crucial in determining such critical transitions.},
