This is a course that I gave at the [Limnology Institute of the University of Maringá, Brasil](http://www.nupelia.uem.br/), in July 2013. It is an introduction to power laws and generalized dimensions (fractals and multifractals) with applications to ecology, at the same time I introduce the R statistical language. The slides are written in Markdown and the sources are on <https://github.com/lsaravia/MultifractalsInR>
